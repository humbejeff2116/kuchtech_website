      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Dependence on government on all spheres of life is no longer feasible. 
        Government and non-governmental organizations including well meaning 
        individuals have to embark on a number of strategies to compliment 
        government efforts in all aspects of human endeavors. The health sector 
        is the most delicate, as it centreâ€™s on the survival of the society. 
        Despite the existence of a college or schools of Health Technologies in 
        each state of the Federation, as well as some private/community initiatives 
        in establishing same in the country, still there is need of establishment of 
        such schools due to the much growing populace. In order to cater for the over 
        increasing needs of the society coupled with the location imbalances of the 
        colleges/school hence the idea of the establishment of Kumase College of health 
        technology LTD, in Benue by like minded individuals.  
        It shortage of Health personnel's amongst its educational programmes, it brings  
        the ideal of establishing  kumase College of Health Technology to complement government 
        effort in producing trained health personnel not only to produce health personnel 
        but to create Job opportunities for Nigerians.
