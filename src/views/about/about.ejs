        About us
      </h2>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Dependence on government on all spheres of life is no longer feasible. 
        Non-governmental organizations including well meaning individuals have to embark 
        on a number of calculated strategies to compliment government efforts in all aspects 
        of human endeavours. Despite the existence of numerous colleges or schools of Health 
        Technologies in each state of the Federation, as well as some private/community initiatives 
        also established in the country, we reasoned that there is still need for establishment of 
        more schools or colleges of health due to the continious increase in human populaton and. 
        In order to cater for the ever increasing needs of the society, coupled with the 
        improper location or imbalances of some colleges/schools of health technology, the idea 
        of establishing Kumase College of Health Technology in Benue state by like minded 
        individuals came up. The college aims at helping to improve on the shortage of health 
        personnel's, and also complement government's efforts in producing trained health personnel 
        and create job opportunities for our beloved Nigerians.
